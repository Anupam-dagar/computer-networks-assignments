# Ques 2a

## Problem Statement
Send  a  C  structure  that  includes  data  of  type  character,  integer  and  float  from  client1 to the server. The server should change the values so that client2 receives a structure with entirely different data. It is not permitted that the data should be converted to any other data type before transmission.

## Instructions to run
1. Compile the files `server.c`, `client1.c` and `client2.c`. For this run the `compile.sh` script as follows  
`./compile.sh`  
If the above gives some error then use  
`sudo bash compile.sh`  
to run the script.
Alternatively you can compile using the following commands:  
`gcc server.c -o server`  
`gcc client1.c -o client1`  
`gcc client2.c -o client2`
2. Open three terminals, run server, client1 and client2 in the same order. Make sure to run server first and client2 only after client1 has completed its function.  
`./server` (terminal 1)   
`./client1` (terminal 2)  
send data from client1  
`./client2` (terminal 3)   
3. Follow the on screen instructions.
